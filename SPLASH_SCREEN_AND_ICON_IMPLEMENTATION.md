# Splash Screen and App Icon Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a beautiful splash screen animation and updated the app icon for SmartExpenses. The app now has a professional look with smooth animations and a custom wallet-themed icon.

## App Icon Changes

### New App Icon Design
- **Theme**: Wallet/Money management icon representing personal finance
- **Colors**: Blue to green gradient background (#2196F3 to #4CAF50)
- **Foreground**: White wallet with green money symbol (â‚¹)
- **Style**: Modern, clean design with rounded corners

### Files Modified
- `app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher_foreground.xml` - New wallet icon design
- `app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher_background.xml` - Gradient background
- `app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml` - Added icon background color

## Splash Screen Implementation

### Features
- **Beautiful Gradient Background**: Blue to green gradient matching the app icon
- **Animated Logo**: Bouncing wallet icon with scale and fade animations
- **Sequential Text Animations**:

  - "Your Personal Expenses App" subtitle slides in from right
  - "Built in India, for India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³" fades in with Indian flag emoji
- **Loading Indicator**: Circular progress indicator with smooth animation
- **Smooth Transitions**: Fade transitions between splash and main app

### Animation Sequence
1. **0.5s**: Logo appears with bounce animation
2. **1.3s**: App title slides in from left
3. **1.9s**: Subtitle slides in from right
4. **2.5s**: "Made in India" text fades in
