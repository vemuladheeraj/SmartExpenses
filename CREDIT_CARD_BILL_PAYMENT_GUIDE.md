# Credit Card Bill Payment Handling Guide

## Overview
This document explains how the SmartExpenses app now properly handles credit card bill payments, ensuring they are correctly classified as **DEBIT** (expenses) rather than **CREDIT** (income).

## The Problem
Previously, the app treated the word "paid" as a DEBIT indicator, but this could be ambiguous. Credit card bill payments often use phrases like:
- "Rs.5000 **paid** towards credit card bill"
- "Credit card bill **payment** of Rs.3000"
- "Statement **payment** of Rs.2000"

These should be treated as **DEBIT** transactions (expenses) because:
1. You're paying money to reduce your credit card debt
2. It's an outflow from your bank account
3. It's an expense, not income

## Enhanced Solution

### 1. **Credit Card Bill Payment Keywords**
```kotlin
private val creditCardBillKeywords = Regex("""(?i)\b(?:credit\s+card\s+bill|cc\s+bill|card\s+bill|credit\s+bill|bill\s+payment|statement\s+payment|outstanding\s+amount|due\s+amount|minimum\s+amount|full\s+payment|partial\s+payment)\b""")
```

**Detects:**
- `credit card bill` - Standard credit card bill
- `cc bill` - Abbreviated credit card bill
- `card bill` - Generic card bill
- `credit bill` - Credit-related bill
- `bill payment` - Bill payment
- `statement payment` - Statement payment
- `outstanding amount` - Outstanding balance
- `due amount` - Due amount
- `minimum amount` - Minimum payment
- `full payment` - Full payment
- `partial payment` - Partial payment

### 2. **Enhanced Transaction Type Determination**
```kotlin
private fun determineTransactionType(body: String): String? {
    // First, check if this is a credit card bill payment
    if (creditCardBillKeywords.containsMatchIn(body)) {
        return "DEBIT" // Credit card bill payments are expenses (DEBIT)
    }
    
    // Check for CREDIT indicators
    if (body.contains(Regex("""(?i)credited|received|deposited|successful|completed"""))) {
        return "CREDIT"
    }
    
    // Check for DEBIT indicators
    if (body.contains(Regex("""(?i)debited|withdrawn|deducted|sent|charged|processed"""))) {
        return "DEBIT"
    }
    
    // Handle "paid" keyword carefully - it can mean different things
    if (body.contains(Regex("""(?i)paid"""))) {
        // If it's a credit card bill payment, it's DEBIT
        if (creditCardBillKeywords.containsMatchIn(body)) {
            return "DEBIT"
        }
        // If it's payment received, it's CREDIT
        if (body.contains(Regex("""(?i)received|credited|deposited"""))) {
            return "CREDIT"
        }
        // If it's payment sent/made, it's DEBIT
        if (body.contains(Regex("""(?i)sent|made|to|for"""))) {
            return "DEBIT"
        }
        // Default for "paid" is DEBIT (expense)
        return "DEBIT"
    }
    
    return null
}
```

## How It Works

### **Step 1: Priority Check for Credit Card Bills**
The function first checks if the SMS contains credit card bill payment keywords. If found, it immediately returns **DEBIT** because:
- Credit card bill payments are always expenses
- They reduce your credit card debt
- Money flows out of your account

### **Step 2: Standard CREDIT/DEBIT Detection**
If no credit card bill keywords are found, it follows the standard logic:
- **CREDIT**: `credited`, `received`, `deposited`, `successful`, `completed`
- **DEBIT**: `debited`, `withdrawn`, `deducted`, `sent`, `charged`, `processed`

### **Step 3: Smart "Paid" Keyword Handling**
The word "paid" is ambiguous and requires context analysis:

#### **Credit Card Bill Payment (DEBIT)**
```
"Rs.5000 paid towards credit card bill" â†’ DEBIT
"Credit card bill payment of Rs.3000" â†’ DEBIT
"Statement payment of Rs.2000" â†’ DEBIT
```

#### **Payment Received (CREDIT)**
```
"Rs.5000 received and paid to your account" â†’ CREDIT
"Amount credited and paid" â†’ CREDIT
```

#### **Payment Sent (DEBIT)**
```
"Rs.2000 paid to John" â†’ DEBIT
"Payment made to merchant" â†’ DEBIT
"Amount paid for services" â†’ DEBIT

#### **Default Behavior**
If "paid" appears without clear context, it defaults to **DEBIT** (expense) because:
- Most payments are expenses
- It's safer to assume expense than income
- Users can manually correct if needed
