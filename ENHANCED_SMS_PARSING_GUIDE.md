# Enhanced SMS Parsing & Transfer Detection Guide

## Overview
This document details the comprehensive improvements made to the SmartExpenses SMS parsing system to address potential issues with wrong amount detection, spam message handling, and transfer detection accuracy.

## üö® Issues Addressed

### 1. **Wrong Amount Detection**
- **Problem**: System could extract amounts from promotional messages, balance alerts, and credit limit notifications
- **Solution**: Enhanced amount validation with context checking

### 2. **Spam Message Processing**
- **Problem**: Marketing SMS, promotional offers, and balance updates were being processed as transactions
- **Solution**: Multi-layered spam detection system

### 3. **Transfer Detection Inaccuracy**
- **Problem**: Internal transfers between accounts were being counted as income/expenses
- **Solution**: Enhanced transfer detection with multiple scenarios

### 4. **Credit Card Bill Payment Misclassification**
- **Problem**: Credit card bill payments were incorrectly classified as transfers
- **Solution**: Corrected classification to DEBIT (expenses)

## üîß Technical Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Spam Detection**

#### **SpamDetector Object**
```kotlin
private object SpamDetector {
    private val spamKeywords = listOf(
        "cashback", "rewards", "offer", "discount", "promotion", "limited time", 
        "special price", "bonus", "free", "gift", "win", "lucky", "chance",
        "exclusive", "premium", "vip", "elite", "gold", "platinum", "diamond",
        "congratulations", "you've won", "claim your", "activate now",
        "click here", "call now", "sms to", "reply with", "urgent"
    )
    
    private val promotionalPatterns = listOf(
        Regex("""(?i)(?:get|earn|receive)\s+‚Çπ?\d+"""),
        Regex("""(?i)(?:spend|purchase)\s+‚Çπ?\d+\s+(?:and|to)\s+(?:get|earn|receive)"""),
        Regex("""(?i)(?:minimum|min)\s+(?:spend|purchase|transaction)\s+‚Çπ?\d+"""),
        Regex("""(?i)(?:valid|offer)\s+(?:till|until|upto|till|by)\s+\d{1,2}[/\-\.]\d{1,2}[/\-\.]\d{2,4}"""),
        Regex("""(?i)(?:terms|conditions|t&c|tc)\s+(?:apply|applicable)"""),
        Regex("""(?i)(?:limited|limited\s+time|hurry|rush|quick)""")
    )
}
```

**Detection Logic:**
- **2+ spam keywords** = Spam message
- **2+ promotional patterns** = Spam message  
- **3+ promotional words** = Spam message

#### **Examples of Blocked Spam:**
```
‚ùå "Get ‚Çπ500 cashback on your next transaction"
‚ùå "Earn ‚Çπ1000 rewards on spending ‚Çπ5000"
‚ùå "Limited time offer: 50% off above ‚Çπ1000"
‚ùå "Congratulations! You've won ‚Çπ1000"
‚ùå "Activate now and get ‚Çπ500 bonus"
```

### 2. **Enhanced Amount Validation**

#### **AmountValidator Object**
```kotlin
private object AmountValidator {
    private const val MIN_AMOUNT_PAISE = 1000L // ‚Çπ10 minimum
    private const val MAX_AMOUNT_PAISE = 1000000000L // ‚Çπ10 crore maximum
    
    fun isValidTransactionAmount(amountMinor: Long, body: String): Boolean {
        // Basic range validation
        if (amountMinor < MIN_AMOUNT_PAISE || amountMinor > MAX_AMOUNT_PAISE) {
            return false
        }
        
        // Check if amount appears in actual transaction context
        val hasTransactionContext = body.contains(Regex("""(?i)(?:credited|debited|withdrawn|deposited|sent|received|paid|charged|deducted|transferred|processed)"""))
        
        if (!hasTransactionContext) return false
        
        // Check for balance/limit indicators that shouldn't be transactions
        val balanceLimitPatterns = listOf(
            Regex("""(?i)(?:balance|bal)\s+(?:is|:)\s*‚Çπ?\d+"""),
            Regex("""(?i)(?:credit\s+)?limit\s+(?:is|:)\s*‚Çπ?\d+"""),
            Regex("""(?i)(?:available|avail)\s+(?:balance|credit)\s*‚Çπ?\d+"""),
            Regex("""(?i)(?:total|outstanding)\s+(?:amount|balance)\s*‚Çπ?\d+""")
        )
        
        // If it looks like a balance/limit message, it's not a transaction
        if (balanceLimitPatterns.any { it.containsMatchIn(body) }) {
            return false
        }
        
        return true
    }
}
```

#### **Examples of Blocked Amounts:**
```
‚ùå "Your balance is ‚Çπ50,000" (Balance alert)
‚ùå "Credit limit: ‚Çπ1,00,000" (Limit notification)
‚ùå "Available credit: ‚Çπ25,000" (Credit status)
‚ùå "Outstanding amount: ‚Çπ15,000" (Balance info)
‚ùå "Get ‚Çπ1 cashback" (Promotional amount)
```

### 3. **Enhanced Transfer Detection**

#### **TransferDetectionResult Sealed Class**
```kotlin
sealed class TransferDetectionResult {
    object REGULAR_TRANSACTION : TransferDetectionResult()
    object INTERNAL_TRANSFER : TransferDetectionResult()
    object SELF_TRANSFER : TransferDetectionResult()
    object ACCOUNT_TRANSFER : TransferDetectionResult()
}
```

#### **Transfer Detection Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: Internal Transfer (DEBIT + CREDIT pairs)**
```kotlin
// Check for same-amount opposite transactions within 5-minute window
val oppositeEvents = events.filter { 
    it.type != currentType && 
    kotlin.math.abs(currentTs - it.timestamp) <= WINDOW_MS 
}

if (oppositeEvents.isNotEmpty()) {
    // Check for strong transfer indicators
    val hasStrongTransferIndicators = hasStrongTransferIndicators(currentBody, oppositeEvents, currentSender, currentAccountTail)
    if (hasStrongTransferIndicators) {
        return TransferDetectionResult.INTERNAL_TRANSFER
    }
}
```

**Scenario 2: Self Transfer Keywords**
```kotlin
private fun hasSelfTransferKeywords(body: String): Boolean {
    val selfTransferPatterns = listOf(
        Regex("""(?i)self\s+transfer"""),
        Regex("""(?i)own\s+account"""),
        Regex("""(?i)same\s+account"""),
        Regex("""(?i)account\s+transfer"""),
        Regex("""(?i)internal\s+transfer"""),
        Regex("""(?i)own\s+transfer""")
    )
    
    return selfTransferPatterns.any { it.containsMatchIn(body) }
}
```

**Scenario 3: Account-to-Account Transfer Patterns**
```kotlin
private fun hasAccountTransferPattern(body: String): Boolean {
    // Check for patterns like "from A/c XXXX to A/c YYYY"
    val accountTransferPattern = Regex("""(?i)(?:from|to)\s+(?:a/c|account|ac|acc)\s+[xX]{4,}\d{4,}""")
    val accountCount = accountTransferPattern.findAll(body).count()
    
    return accountCount >= 2 // At least two account references
}
```

### 4. **Enhanced Transaction Type Determination**

#### **Credit Card Bill Payment Logic**
```kotlin
private fun determineTransactionType(body: String): String? {
    // First, check if this is a credit card bill payment - these are DEBIT (expenses), not TRANSFER
    if (creditCardBillKeywords.containsMatchIn(body)) {
        return "DEBIT" // Credit card bill payments are expenses, not transfers
    }
    
    // Check for CREDIT indicators
    if (body.contains(Regex("""(?i)credited|received|deposited|successful|completed"""))) {
        return "CREDIT"
    }
    
    // Check for DEBIT indicators
    if (body.contains(Regex("""(?i)debited|withdrawn|deducted|sent|charged|processed"""))) {
        return "DEBIT"
    }
    
    // Handle "paid" keyword carefully - it can mean different things
    if (body.contains(Regex("""(?i)paid"""))) {
        // If it's a credit card bill payment, it's DEBIT
        if (creditCardBillKeywords.containsMatchIn(body)) {
            return "DEBIT"
        }
        // If it's payment received, it's CREDIT
        if (body.contains(Regex("""(?i)received|credited|deposited"""))) {
            return "CREDIT"
        }
        // If it's payment sent/made, it's DEBIT
        if (body.contains(Regex("""(?i)sent|made|to|for"""))) {
            return "DEBIT"
        }
        // Default for "paid" is DEBIT (expense)
        return "DEBIT"
    }
    
    return null
}
```

## üìä Transfer Detection Examples

### **Example 1: Internal Transfer Between Accounts**
```
SMS 1: "Rs.10,000 debited from A/c XX1234 for transfer to A/c XX5678"
SMS 2: "Rs.10,000 credited to A/c XX5678 via transfer from A/c XX1234"

Result: Both marked as TRANSFER, excluded from income/expense totals
```

### **Example 2: Self Transfer**
```
SMS: "Rs.5,000 transferred from your savings to your current account"

Result: Marked as TRANSFER, excluded from income/expense totals
```

### **Example 3: Account-to-Account Transfer**
```
SMS: "Rs.20,000 transferred from A/c XX1111 to A/c XX2222"

Result: Marked as TRANSFER, excluded from income/expense totals
```

### **Example 4: Regular Transaction**
```
SMS: "Rs.500 debited for UPI payment to Amazon"

Result: Marked as DEBIT (expense), included in expense totals
```

D/HomeVm: Imported CREDIT (Income): Salary - ‚Çπ50000 from ICICI Bank
D/HomeVm: Imported DEBIT (Expense): Amazon - ‚Çπ500 from HDFC Bank
```

### **SMS Rejection Logging:**
```
D/HomeVm: SMS parsing failed for PROMO: Get ‚Çπ500 cashback...
D/SmsParser: Rejected spam message: Get ‚Çπ500 cashback...
D/SmsParser: Rejected invalid amount: 100 for body: Balance: ‚Çπ100...
```

## üìà Performance Improvements

### **Memory Management:**
- Reduced `MAX_EVENTS_PER_AMOUNT` from 20 to 10
- Increased transfer detection window from 3 to 5 minutes
- Bounded list growth to prevent memory issues

### **Processing Efficiency:**
